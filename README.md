# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project wasto build a dynamic webpage that accepts user inputs and adjusts accordingly. JavaScript, basic HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS were used to build the interactive page and style it to make it visually appealing. The web page includes a header, a brief article with a summary, and a table that organizes the given data. The table holds and neatly displays the data we are working with, and filters were added to allow users to refine their search using multiple criteria. The table is inserted and displayed by an HTML page and stored as a JavaScript array. 

## Results
When the webpage is opened, the user can see the title with an imported picture as the background. A subheading that introduces the user to the content of the webpage is visible on the left side and a brief introduction article can be seen on the right. As the user scrolls down, they are presented with accounts of UFO sitings organized by date, city, state, country, shape, duration, and comments on the right side. The search bars can be found to the left. These search bars are where users can input specific criteria to filter the data. Once search criteria are input by the user, the webpage updates and displays the filtered results.

## Summary 
One drawback of this design is that the user may not undertand what the "shape" criteria means. I would modify thise search box and specify whether "shape" is referring to the aircraft or to the formation of the aircrafts if there were more than one present. Two recommendations I suggest for further development is to include a criteria that indicates if there was a single aircraft or multiple, as well as to include a search for key words in the comments. Additionally, I would add a feature that collects and uploads new UFO sitings to the webpage as they are reported.
